Path Finding Visualizer (DSA Project)

This project is a Path Finding Visualizer developed as part of my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) course.
It visually demonstrates how classic graph traversal algorithms explore nodes and find a path between a start and an end point on a grid.

The application is built using Flask (Python) on the backend and uses a grid-based system where users can interactively place start/end nodes, add walls, and observe algorithm behavior step by step.

🔹 IMPLEMENTED ALGORITHMS

Breadth First Search (BFS)

Depth First Search (DFS)

🔹 KEY FEATURES

Interactive grid-based environment

Set start and end nodes dynamically

Add and remove obstacles (walls)

Visualizes visited nodes during traversal

Displays the final path if found

Shows performance metrics such as:

Path length

Number of nodes explored

Random maze generation with adjustable density

🔹 TECHNOLOGIES USED

Python

Flask

Data Structures & Algorithms

Graph Traversal Techniques

🔹 LEARNING OUTCOME

This project helped me gain a strong practical understanding of graph traversal algorithms, path reconstruction, and how theoretical DSA concepts can be visualized using real-world applications.
